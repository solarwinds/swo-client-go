  Search for events

  WARNING - This field is broken when it is used on the results of an `{ entities { search } }` query.
  The paging is broken and pages over the entire set of events for all entities.  It does not page over the events per entity.
  This results in weird and unexpected behavior for example if you use a value of `limit: 1` it will limit the results to one event for the entire set of entities, not one event per entity.  This field will be deprecated under the `{ entities { search } }` query results, so don't use it.
  If you need to page over events for one entity you can use this field under the `{ entities { byId } }` query since the paging is only done on the events for a single entity.  You can also use the events API directly.
